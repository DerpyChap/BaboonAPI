Trombone Champ modding API, aiming to provide nicer hooks to
promote compatibility & improve the base game code

## Installing

You can find the mod on [Thunderstore](https://trombone-champ.thunderstore.io/package/TromboneChamps/BaboonAPI/).

### Manual installation

1. Install BepInEx over the base game
2. Install FSharp.Core - `FSharp.Core.dll` gets put in `bin/Release/net472`
   by the build process, I usually put it in `BepInEx/core`
3. Put `BaboonAPI.dll` in the plugins folder
4. Toot!

## Developer Usage

We have documentation over at https://baboonapi.trombone.wiki
